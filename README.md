# Project-1-Game

Basic idea of the game is to make it to the end without getting hit. Once the game starts though you will automatically start moving forward and you can only jump over obstacles and on platforms. Good Luck. 

This Project was done as an assignment at General Assembly, with the following requirements:

	Your game should have two pages: a landing page and a game page
	Use only jQuery for DOM manipulation
	Deploy your game online to GitHub pages
	Include at least one CSS transition fired by a DOM event
	Choose an existing landing page on the web that includes a form; screen shot the landing page, and replicate its markup to create a separate game landing page that links to your game
	Use your form to collect information about the user and display that information on the game page; be sure to add things to your form, if needed, like buttons, sliders, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
	Style your form, landing page, and game page with class-based CSS (not inline styles)
	Include a media query for a tablet to make your pages responsive
	Use flexbox to build your grid system
	Create and get approval for a wireframe for your game page
	Comment your code appropriately
	Adhere to the AirBnB style guide for writing your JavaScript
	Adhere to the Google style guide for writing your HTML/CSS

Original Scope: 

	Description: The main objective of the game is get to the finish line at the end while jumping over hazards and on platforms. Player and platforms are squares while triangles are main hazards. Hitting the side of a platform is a game over. Hitting the top of a triangle is game over. Easy right?

	Technology: HTML and CSS to style to stage, player, and hazards. Jquery to control the movement of the stage, the players jump, and the collision between the objects.

	Stretch Goals: Either Two levels or two difficulty settings, Normal and Hard
	
What was left unfinished, and will be worked on in the future: 

	An Additional stage, with more platforming, and a bit higher difficulty. 

	Scoring. Tracking the number of attempts per stage.

	Styling the game into the format of the landing page.
	Background music 

	More responsive controls. At the moment the jumps feel too floaty. 

	Perhaps a different implementation of collision, outside the limitations of the project.
