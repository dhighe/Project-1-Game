# Project-1-Game

Basic idea of the game is to make it to the end without getting hit. Once the game starts though you will automatically start moving forward and you can only jump over obstacles and on platforms. Good Luck. 

This Project was done as an assignment at General Assembly, with the following requirements:
Your game should have two pages: a landing page and a game page
Use only jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online to GitHub pages
Include at least one CSS transition fired by a DOM event
Choose an existing landing page on the web that includes a form; screen shot the landing page, and replicate its markup to create a separate game landing page that links to your game
Use your form to collect information about the user and display that information on the game page; be sure to add things to your form, if needed, like buttons, sliders, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
Style your form, landing page, and game page with class-based CSS (not inline styles)
Include a media query for a tablet to make your pages responsive
Use flexbox to build your grid system
Create and get approval for a wireframe for your game page
Comment your code appropriately
